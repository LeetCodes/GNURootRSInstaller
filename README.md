# GNURootRSLauncher

Repository for https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gnuroot.rsinstaller

This can be built using any version of Android Studio that supports experimental gradle build 0.7.3
and the Android NDK.

GNURoot Runescape Launcher relies on [GNURootDebian](https://github.com/corbinlc/GNURootDebian) to run. See its
README for instructions to build a launcher of your own!
